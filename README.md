Overview: My whole project is based on turtle module of Python which I learned from Youtube tutorials and GEeksforGeeks website.

Design and Implementation: I used similar design as shown in tutorials and in geeksforgeeks also I did some changes from my side, like taking user input, for number of sides of shape, length of shape, colour of turtle, and also some other to create new patterns and some used patterns also.

You will get a list with shapes and number mentioned just enter the desired number and in some case inputs also then switch to turtle graphics from taskbar ( if not opens automatically).

For logic you can just see the attached table and and basic steps for turtle to run.

Challenges and Problems: It was easy project and I am looking forward so that I can create some more like that. First I decided to create GAMA OF LIFE but found that more complicated than my level so decided to drop that idea and I came up with this idea that I saw while finding libraries for GAME OF LIFE. Now I am looking forward to learn program so that I can easily create GAME OF LIFE and other complicated games.

Hope you like my project
